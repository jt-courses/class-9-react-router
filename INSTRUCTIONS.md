# Instructions to add React Router

1. Checkout the [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/). React Router comes in two flavors: one for the web, and one for React Native. We only care about the "web" version in this class.
1. Add `react-router-dom` as a dependency in `package.json`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to your project's root directory and run `npm install` to install the new dependency. (This downloads the [`react-router-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) package from `npm`.)
